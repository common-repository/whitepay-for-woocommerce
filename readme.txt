2. The client enters our form and then chooses the payment method "WhiteBIT Pay". Then the client has to choose the cryptocurrency he wants to pay with. The amount to be paid is automatically calculated after selecting the currency.
3. The user clicks the payment button and goes to the screen with the payment details.

3. The speed of the transaction increases significantly since the whole process takes place within the exchange. Also the absence of network fee.
